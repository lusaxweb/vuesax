# Why Vuesax?

<box header>

  We would love to explain to you why we created Vuesax, what advantages it has and what is our purpose

</box>


<box>

## Introduction

Vuesax is a framework of components based on vuejs, it is a framework that is designed from scratch to be incrementally adoptable.

The framework is focused on facilitating the development of applications, improving the design of the same without removing the necessary functionality. we want all the components to be independent in colors, shapes and design for a freedom that we like all front-end but without losing the speed of creation and production.

## Porque Vuesax?

The truth vuesax is now starting and has a long way to go. components to create, improve and fix so for now vuesax should not be used for a real application, however we are working very hard to achieve the stable version and have the strength to use it in any application.

- Vuesax is a framework designed to have a lot of visual impact and that is always in trend with respect to design.
- Several components for the use and creation of an entire application
- adaptive design in all components
- An open source community to create improve and fix any component or function
- Independent components so as not to import unnecessary code
- Semantic components
- Markdown documents for better maintainability
- and much more

## Apoyar a Vuesax

Vuesax is just beginning and we love the contribution of our community that for now is not so great but very talented, If you like what we do and as we go we invite you to help and contribute as little as a change of grammatical error in the documents until a new component or improvement we are very grateful for the support of the whole community.

This framework is open source and every day you are working on improvements, components, and documents if you have something new, a problem using it or simply an error in the documents you would not love to support with an issues or a request to always improve and that each dia vuesax is a better framework for our front-end community.
