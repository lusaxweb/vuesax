# Why Vuesax?

<box header>

  We would love to explain to you why we created Vuesax, what advantages it has, and our purpose

</box>


<box>

## Introduction

Vuesax is a framework of components based on Vuejs; it is a framework that is designed from scratch to be incrementally adoptable.

The framework is focused on facilitating the development of applications, improving the design of the same without removing the necessary functionality. We want all the components to be independent in colors, shapes, and design for a freedom that we like all in front-end development, but without losing the speed of creation and production.

## Why Vuesax?

The truth is, Vuesax has a long way to go in terms of development. Components must be created, improved and fixed. For now, Vuesax should not be used for a real application. However, we are working very hard to achieve the stable version and have the strength to use it in any application.

- Vuesax is a framework designed to have a lot of visual impact and that is always in trend with respect to design.
- Many components for the use and creation of an entire application
- Adaptive design in all components
- An open source community to create, improve, and fix any component or function
- Independent components to prevent importing unnecessary code
- Semantic components
- Markdown documents for better maintainability
- And much more

## Support Vuesax

Vuesax is just beginning and we love the contribution of our small, but talented community. If you like Vuesax, we invite you to help and contribute. It can be as little as a grammatical change in the documentation, or the development of a new component or improvement. Either way, we are very grateful for the support of the whole community.

This framework is open source and every day the community is working on improvements, components, and documentation. If you have a new idea, a problem using Vuesax, or simply see an error in the documentation, we would love your support! Improve Vuesax by opening an issue or making a pull request so that each day Vuesax is a better framework for our front-end community.

- Easy to update documentation to improve and create
- Independent colors in each component, if necessary
- Rapid update flow, improvements and new functionalities
- Designed from scratch to be incrementally adoptable

## Our goal

We want to be the first framework of Vuejs components that help create thousands of applications. We also hope to grow a large community of developers that support one another in creating and improving products.
